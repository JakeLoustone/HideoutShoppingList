# HideoutShoppingList

The HideoutShoppingList mod will create a shopping list of what items are needed for upgrade in your Character's Note section(viewable from within raid). At the end of every raid the mod will, take a look at the hideout areas you have enabled to be tracked in the config.json, put together a list of items you require for upgrading each area, and tally up each required item you already have in your stash, and then save the note in your Character's note section.
